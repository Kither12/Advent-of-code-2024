# Advent of Code 2024 - Multilingual Solutions ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to this unique Advent of Code 2024 repository! The goal is to solve each puzzle in as many different programming languages as possible. Let's celebrate the diversity of programming languages and learn from each other's solutions!

# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions in any programming language! Here's how you can contribute:

## Rules ðŸ“‹

1. **One Language Per Solution**: Each day can have only one solution per language.
2. **Unique Languages**: Choose a language that hasn't been implemented yet for that day.
3. **Better Solutions**: If you want to submit a solution in a language that's already implemented:
   - Clearly explain why your solution is better (performance, readability, etc.)
   - The community will review and decide if it should replace the existing solution.
